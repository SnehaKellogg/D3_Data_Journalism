          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>There is a negative relationship between Income and smokers, and also between Income and Healthcare access.
            So as we move up on the ladder on Income distribution, the fraction of the smokers in decreases. 
            However, there could be other factors generating the variation, which doesn't explain this in all the states.
            For example, Texas is a state where the fraction of people lacking healthcare is the highest in the country, 
            but it is in the middle range in terms of smokers, this may be related to state regulations on smoking.
          </p>
        <p>I was able to create a graph with income and smoking earlier and I changed something which is not letting that and the circle work properly
          I wasn't careful with version control! The other app js files has some of that code but haven't been able to rectify all of the code.
